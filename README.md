### This is the administrative backend for Open eOSCE.
#####Please find the client app at https://github.com/alandow/Open_eOSCE_mobile 

Open eOSCE allows you to mark OSCE's created using the Open eOSCE application.

Open eOSCE is a way of conducting and managing Clincal Skills Assessments (or any skills assessment, really) electronically, rather than a paper-based format. The aims of Open eOSCE are to:

- Reduce administrative workload
- Reduce errors in data capture
- Provide timely feedback to participants
- Allow an OSCE to be conducted across multiple locations simultaneously
- Allow simplified quantitative and qualitative analysis of results for quality assurance and improvement

Open eOSCE is based upon lessons learned from developing UNE eOSCE, a project developed in 2014 by the School of Rural Medicine at the University of New England, Armidale. 

Open eOSCE backend is built using Laravel.
